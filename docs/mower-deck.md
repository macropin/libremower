## Mower Deck

The mower deck presents the greatest design challenge. We need to find off the shelf items that can be adapted as necessary to construct a deck:

Motor:

Need a motor with sufficient power, robust shaft and bearings, and appropriate RPM characteristics. This may be suitable: https://www.motiondynamics.com.au/unite-my8216-200w-12v-or-24v-dc-motor-3200-rpm.html

Blade Cover:

Consider using a stainless baking tray. These appear to be available in a range of appropriate sizes eg:
