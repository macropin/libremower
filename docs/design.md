# Design

The design target is currently the following:

- 25.2V nominal power system, achieved with 2 x 12.6V LiFePO4 100Ah batteries (simplicity and low cost)
- PixHawk flight controller and compatible GPS modules (UM982) for rover and base station
- Motor ESC running AM32 open source firmware, and with minimum "8S" voltage capacity (29.6v), and minimum 20A (eg NeutronRC 70A-G071)
- 2 x 10" rear wheels with BLDC hub motor and encoders
- 2 x 5" front castor wheels
- 400W mower motor
- 40cm blade width

Chassis will be fabricated from either 2020/4040 aluminium profile, or uni-strut, or possibly steel section depending on availability.

The chassis will employ a zero-turn kinematic design. Final dimensions to be determined.
