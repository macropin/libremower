# RPM calculations

## Blade Speed

19,000 feet per minute (**215 mph**, 347 km/h) is the maximum tip speed lawn mowers may be run according to the ANSI B71.1 safety standard.

Some motor rpm / blade length calculations:

| RPM  | Blade Length (cm) | Speed (mph) | Speed (km/h) |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 2900 | 40                | 135         | 219          |
| 3000 | 45                | 158         | 254          |
| 5000 | 34                | 199         | 320          |
| 6000 | 30                | 210         | 338          |
| 7000 | 25                | 205         | 330          |

## Motor KV and Battery Voltage:

Estimating the RPM of your motor can be done using the formula KV * Battery Voltage/2 = characteristic RPM, providing a rough figure.

As an example, if you have a 2300KV motor paired with a 3S LiPo battery (with a voltage of 12.6V), your motor would theoretically reach approximately 28,980 RPM (2300KV * 12.6V) under no load conditions.
