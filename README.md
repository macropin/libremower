# SwardBot: Open Source Acreage Mower

Welcome to SwardBot, an open-source hardware project designed to simplify pasture and acreage mowing! SwardBot is an Ardupilot-based mower built with the vision of making large-scale grass maintenance accessible, affordable, and customizable for everyone. (Keywords: UGV, mower, Ardupilot, rover)

## Project Goals

### 1. Low Cost
Our primary objective is to provide an economical solution for acreage and pasture mowing. With an approximate build cost of USD $2,000, SwardBot is designed to be a budget-friendly alternative to commercial mowers.

### 2. Commodity Components
SwardBot relies on readily available components that can be easily sourced from popular online platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress. This ensures that building the mower is not only cost-effective but can be built by anyone as you won't need to hunt for parts from specialty suppliers.

### 3. Minimal Fabrication
No welding or custom fabrication skills are required to build SwardBot. The assembly process involves simple tasks like cutting, drilling, and screwing, making it accessible to individuals with basic DIY skills.

### 4. Versatile Mowing Deck
SwardBot's mowing deck is designed to handle rough pasture and acreage with very tall grass. Its robust construction ensures efficient and effective mowing even in challenging terrains.

## Hackable and Modifiable

SwardBot is not just a mower; it's a platform for agricultural innovation. We encourage users to unleash their creativity by hacking and modifying the system. Whether it's tweaking the hardware for specific applications or adding custom features, SwardBot is designed to be a playground for DIY enthusiasts and innovators.

## Community-Driven Development

As an open-source project, SwardBot thrives on community contributions. We welcome developers, makers, and enthusiasts to join us in shaping the future of the project. By collaborating, sharing ideas, and contributing improvements, we can collectively enhance SwardBot's capabilities and address various user needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with SwardBot, check out the documentation in the '[docs](docs)' directory of this repository. You'll find detailed instructions on sourcing components, assembling the mower, and customizing its features.
