# SwardBot: Open Source Acreage Mower

Welcome to SwardBot, an open-source hardware project designed to simplify building an autonomous mower for large acreage.

SwardBot is an Ardupilot-based mower built with the goal of making the process of building Ardupilot based mowers accessible and affordable to everyone. (Keywords: AGV, UGV, mower, Ardupilot, rover)

## Project Goals

### 1. Low Cost

Our primary objective is to provide an economical solution for autonomous acreage and pasture mowing. With an approximate build cost of USD $2,000, SwardBot is designed to be a budget-friendly alternative to commercial autonomous mowers.

### 2. Commodity Components

SwardBot relies on readily available components that can be easily sourced from popular online platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress. This ensures that building the mower is not only cost-effective but can be built by anyone as you won't need to hunt for parts from specialty suppliers.

### 3. Minimal Fabrication

No welding or custom fabrication skills are required to build SwardBot. The assembly process involves simple tasks like cutting, drilling, and screwing, making it accessible to individuals with basic DIY skills.

### 4. Versatile Mowing Deck

SwardBot's mowing deck is designed to handle pasture and acreage with tall grass. Its robust construction ensures efficient and effective mowing even in challenging terrains.

## Hackable and Modifiable

SwardBot is not just a mower; it's a collection of documentation and design patterns that allow anyone to build an autonomous mower to their own specifications.

## Community-Driven Development

As an open-source project, SwardBot thrives on community contributions. We welcome developers, makers, and enthusiasts to join us in shaping the future of the project. By collaborating, sharing ideas, and contributing improvements, we can collectively enhance SwardBot's capabilities and address various user needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with SwardBot, check out the documentation in the '[docs](docs)' directory of this repository. You'll find detailed instructions on sourcing components, assembling the mower, and customising its features. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create a GitHub issue and contribute to the project!

## Project Status

The project is still in the prototyping phase. A bunch of parts have been selected and ordered. Once the first prototype is build, and the parts are validated, the details will be documented allowing anyone to follow along and build a SwardBot.
